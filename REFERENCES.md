## Key Concepts

- **Dolbear's Law** — Linear relationship between cricket chirp rate and ambient temperature. Applies to crickets and katydids.

- **Stridulation** — Sound production by rubbing body parts (scraper + file). Crickets, katydids.

- **Tymbal mechanism** — Sound production via buckling of ribbed membranes. Cicadas.

- **Active communication space** — The region in which an organism's signal can be detected by a receiver, shaped by environment and propagation.
